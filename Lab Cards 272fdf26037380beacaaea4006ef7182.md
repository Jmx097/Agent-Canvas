# Lab Cards

Category: Asset Labs

## How we learn fast and ship with confidence

**What Lab Cards are**

One-page guides for each live/async lab. They spell out the goal, prep, in-session steps, decisions, proof to submit, and which gate they unlock. They pair with the Labs Agendas hosted in the Link Hub.

**Why they matter**

Labs are the checkpoints that keep this program ROI-true: you’ll attend/watch, ship the deliverable, and move through green/yellow/red gates. The guarantee requires doing the labs and posting proof.

**When labs happen**

- **Lab #1 (Review + Go/No-Go):** end of Week 2 (around Day 10). Decide if your agent overlay is ready. Post 3 fixes + Go/No-Go.
- **Lab #2 (Implementation & scale):** end of Week 3 (around Day 20). Deepen config, validate budgets, prep next moves. (Host note: “Keep Labs on Days 10 & 20.”)

**Where to find them in the Link Hub**

- **Labs Agenda #1** and **Labs Agenda #2** live under `/Starter-Pack-Core/10_Labs-Calendar/…` and are linked in the Link Hub table. Use them with the matching Lab Cards.

## What’s inside every Lab Card

- **Goal** (what “done” looks like this session)
- **Prep checklist** (tools connected, tracker ready, baselines logged)
- **Live agenda** (time-boxed steps from the Labs Agenda)
- **Decision box** (Go/No-Go + thresholds) — Lab #1 ties to the Week-2 gate logic.
- **Proof to submit** (screenshots/links: ROI Tracker row, Run-Log rows, canvas image, short Loom)
- **Gate impact** (what clears/unlocks next)
- **Risks & red-team** (top failure modes to test)
- **Follow-ups** (Booster Tasks if yellow/red; or stretch goal if green)

## Path-specific Lab Cards (how they’re provided)

You’ll see a **Lab #1** and **Lab #2** Card inside each Path Pack folder, customized to that path’s scripts, metrics, and proof.

- **Reactivation**
    - **Lab #1:** List hygiene + Touch #1 quality check; decide Go/No-Go on wider send. Deliverables: 3 fixes + Go/No-Go + Run-Log rows.
    - **Lab #2:** Cadence & booking follow-through; confirm replies/bookings logged to Tracker.
- **Lead Gen**
    - **Lab #1:** ICP seed + first 10 priming messages; confirm budgets/tokens; Go/No-Go.
    - **Lab #2:** Agentic list-build reliability; validate pass rate on 10 samples (tracked).
- **Proposal Acceleration**
    - **Lab #1:** 1-pager quality + follow-up plan; Go/No-Go to agent “draft & send.”
    - **Lab #2:** Follow-up cadence performance; commit stretch targets (won deals/$).
- **Ops Efficiency**
    - **Lab #1:** QA, rollback, alerts; compute before/after delta in Tracker; Go/No-Go for agent overlay.
    - **Lab #2:** HIL + A/B and stability check; log 10/10 runs and hours saved.

> Each Path Pack already lists where your Lab materials live (Agendas, Case Card, ROI slide, etc.) in the Link Hub table so you can copy them into your workspace.

## How a Lab runs (simple flow)

**Before**

- Duplicate the Lab Card + matching Labs Agenda.
- Post your prep: baselines, connected tools, first green test.

**During**

- Follow the agenda, capture decisions, log any fixes. **End with a Go/No-Go.**

**After**

- Submit proof (links + screenshots).
- If **Green**: proceed; if **Yellow**: Booster Task; if **Red**: 1:1 rescue or fast-cash Reactivation lane.

## Proof + downstream assets

Lab outputs flow into: **Case Card 1-pager**, **SOP/Runbook**, and **ROI Snapshot slide** (used for your leadership share). Templates are linked from the Link Hub.

## Update cadence

Lab Cards are refreshed **monthly** to reflect new patterns and keep agendas crisp. The Link Hub shows last-updated dates and folders to copy.
