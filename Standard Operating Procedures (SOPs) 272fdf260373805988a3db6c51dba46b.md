# Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

Category: Playbooks

# **What this page is**

Your one source of truth for “how we do this here.” Each SOP turns a win into a repeatable, low-risk routine that anyone can run.

**Why SOPs matter**

- Make results consistent (less guessing, fewer fires).
- Protect runs with clear **Start / Stop / Approve / Rollback** steps.
- Speed handoffs between humans and digital workers.
- Tie every task to proof (Run-Log, ROI snapshot).

**Where SOPs fit in the system**

- **Agent Cards** = the worker’s bio (what the bot can/can’t do).
- **SOPs** = the rulebook that wraps that worker with guardrails.
- **Run Cards** = the shift checklist you follow today.
- **Lab Cards** = short drills that prove the setup works in your environment.

**What you’ll find here over the coming months**

- **SOP Library (by Path):** Lead Gen, Reactivation, Proposals, Ops.
- **Templates:** copy-paste shells for Start/Stop/Approve/Rollback + troubleshooting.
- **Proof Links:** required spots for Run-Log rows, ROI snapshots, and Case Cards.
- **“Needs Review” view:** SOPs older than 30 days or missing a version.

**How we update this section (monthly)**

On the **first business day of each month** we:

1. Publish a mini-changelog (what changed & why).
2. Flag top SOPs for simplification.
3. Add or retire **Lab Cards** to validate fixes.
4. Nudge owners if **Last Reviewed** > 30 days.

**Submission checklist (keep it tight)**

- Title (verb + object), **Path**, Owner (Process), Maintainer (Tech).
- **Goal (1 sentence)** and **Scope (in/out)**.
- **Inputs → Outputs** (bullets).
- **Start / Stop / Approve (HIL) / Rollback** (4 lines).
- **Troubleshooting:** top 5 branches.
- **Proof Links:** Run-Log, ROI, Case Card.
- Risk level, version, **Last Reviewed** date.

**Quality bar (quick test)**

If a new teammate can run the flow **end-to-end** using only the SOP + linked assets—and post proof—you’ve met the standard.

The goal is to standardize this project over time. This seed creates that capability.

Similarly to the trifecta of leader/manager/worker, this part would be the leader, the cards the managers, and the actual workflows become the work happening 24/7.
