```

**Roles:**

- **Researcher:** finds prospects from approved sources; captures page proof.
- **Qualifier:** checks IC’[P fit (who/where/why now); discards bad matches.
- **Writer:** drafts T1/T2/T3 touches using your Context Pack.
- **QA Gate (HIL):** you approve/reject with reasons (off-tone, wrong ICP, etc.).
- **Scheduler:** inserts booking link / call-back and hands off warm leads.
- **Logger:** writes every step to **Run-Log** (time, cost, pass/fail, notes).
- **Compliance Sentinel:** enforces **Never-Do** list, opt-outs, and caps.

Agentic Browsing has ultimately changed the way we interact with the internet, especially with AI doing most of that work on behalf of us.

**What this is:** A non-technical, step-by-step way to stand up a 24/7 lead pipeline with a governed browser agent. We’re live in **real estate** first, but these same steps work in **any industry**.

**Promise:** More qualified conversations, less manual grind—tracked in your **[ROI Tracker]** and **[Run-Log]**.

This is significantly easier to do with the 30 day roadmap as you’re provided with Run Cards, Agent Cards, and Lab Cards that help you bridge gaps without a heavy ideation lift. 

---

The below is meant to be simple to keep illustrative.

## The Spine (strangers → booked calls)

1. **Aim (14-day win)**
    
    Pick 1 KPI: **calls booked**, **replies**, or **SQLs**. Set a simple $ target (2–5× effort).
    
2. **ICP Map (who/where/why now)**
    
    Niche + geo + deal size + channel.
    
    *Ex:* “Landlords in [ZIPs], 10–50 doors, reply by SMS/email.”
    
3. **Offer & Hooks (one reason to talk)**
    
    One low-friction offer + 3 angles (proof, speed, savings). Keep it human.
    
4. **List Sources (where leads live)**
    
    Choose 2–3 sources you can access today (directories, local pages, associations, inbound forms, past inquiries). Start with **20–50** seeds.
    
5. **Context Pack (what the agent knows)**
    
    Store in **[Link Hub]**: your FAQ, about-you, ICP bullets, offer, proof, “do/don’t” list, approved templates.
    
6. **Guardrails ON (accuracy > volume)**
    
    **HIL ON**, budget caps, step caps, and a **Never-Do** list (no paywalls, no sensitive data, no promises you can’t keep).
    
7. **Agentic Browsing (supervised worker)**
    
    Agent finds prospects, collects basics, drafts first touches, and **stops for your approval** before sending.
    
8. **Messaging Rhythm (3 touches, 7–10 days)**
- **T1:** value + reason to reply (no pitch)
- **T2:** proof + one question
- **T3:** close-the-loop + easy opt-out
1. **Measurement (what gets logged, improves)**
    
    Every run updates **[Run-Log]** (time, cost, pass/fail). **[ROI Tracker]** shows hours saved + pipeline created.

## 14-Day Rollout (copy-paste checklist)

**Day 0–2 (Foundation)**

- Set KPI + $ target → **[ROI Tracker]**
- Fill **ICP + Offer + Context Pack** for your path
- Turn **HIL=ON**, set **caps** + **Never-Do** in Access/Policy Matrix

**Day 3–5 (First Pass)**

- Seed list **20–50** leads (CSV/Sheet)
- Agent runs **research + draft T1** → **you approve**
- Log sends/replies in **[Run-Log]**

**Day 6–10 (Iterate & Multiply)**

- Ship **T2/T3** to engaged leads
- Add 1 new source; refine hooks from real replies

**Day 11–14 (Scale Safely)**

- Raise daily caps **only if** approval rate ≥ **70%**
- Add booking link / call-back slots
- Export a **Case Card** (before/after, screenshots, outcomes)

**Success (hit at least one):**

**10 live conversations**, or **2 SQLs**, or **$500 new revenue** in 14 days

---

## Quality > Quantity (your rulebook)

**Targets to hit before scaling**

- **Approval Rate (HIL):** ≥ **70%** first-pass approvals
- **Positive Reply Rate:** **4–8%**/batch (niche-dependent)
- **Bounce Rate (email):** ≤ **3%**
- **Spam/Unsub:** ≤ **0.1%** per 1,000 sends
- **SQL Rate:** **20–30%** of positives → SQL

**Daily caps (earn scale)**

- **Days 1–3:** 15–25 first touches/day
- **Days 4–7:** 40–60/day *only if* targets met
- **Week 2+:** +20%/day max (never double)

**Auto-brakes**

- **Approval <70%:** pause volume; fix templates/context
- **Bounce >3%:** validate list; switch source or form route
- **PRR <4%** for 3 days: rewrite hooks; retest offer
- **Spam/Unsub >0.1%:** stop; prune list; soften copy; extend cadence

---

## Guardrails that prevent bad output

- **HIL stays ON:** Agent drafts → *You approve* → Send
- **Reject with reason:** off-tone / wrong ICP / too long / weak hook
- **Never-Do list:** no paywalls, no logins you don’t own, no sensitive data, no first-touch attachments, honor opt-outs
- **Tone & length:** 80–120 words; one idea; one ask; reference one **specific line** from their page
- **Compliance basics (US/CA):** sender identity, easy opt-out, honor opt-out within 24h

---

## The Lead Farm (plant → grow → rotate → harvest)

**Plant (inputs):**

Seed lists (20–50) + Context Pack + verified sending setup + calendar link

**Grow (care & feeding):**

3-touch cadence over 7–10 days; spot-check **10%** of profiles & drafts

**Rotate (avoid “soil burn”):**

Rotate **sources**, **segments**, and **templates** weekly

**Harvest (daily goal):**

2–4 qualified replies **or** 1–2 booked calls at your current cap

**Weekly 30-min review:**

Update winning hooks; prune weak sources; add 1 new micro-source

---

## Simple QA Score (1–5⭐ per draft)

- **Relevance** (fits ICP & page context?)
- **Clarity** (one idea, one ask?)
- **Value** (benefit in first sentence?)
- **Proof** (one credible line?)
- **Compliance** (identity, opt-out, no gray claims?)

**Send only 4–5⭐.** 3⭐ = rewrite. 1–2⭐ = fix template/context.

---

## Daily 20-Minute Operator Routine

1. Check **Run-Log** KPIs (Approval, PRR, Bounce)
2. Approve drafts (reject with reason)
3. Add 10–20 new seeds (rotate sources)
4. Update **Context Pack** with 1 learning
5. Log sends/replies → glance **[ROI Tracker]**

---

## What you need

- **Offer:** one sentence + one proof
- **ICP:** who, where, deal size
- **Channel:** inbox you control (email/SMS/DM)
- **Time block:** 20–30 min/day to approve
- **Sheets:** **[ROI Tracker]**, **[Run-Log]**, **[Access/Policy Matrix]**, **[Case Card]**

---

My job has been to make it easier for sales people to make sales.

This means setting the stage with these two core points.

[**Speed-to-lead wins](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads).** Responding within ~5 minutes dramatically increases qualification odds.

Agents are using AI, [but most aren’t experts yet.](https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/realtors-embrace-ai-digital-tools-to-enhance-client-service-nar-survey-finds?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Most thread time spent is on “still learning” over measured predictable outcomes

So what does that look like?

# How It Works (Case Studies)

## Residential Brokerages (teams & solo producers)

### Learn how to revive cold leads + capture new ones 24/7, and then route only hot ones to humans.

1. **“Are you still shopping?” reactivation**
    
    Import 25–50 aged leads → AI drafts SMS based on conversation + trained context → HIL approve → route replies to booking. Use case-proof that 24/7 AI nurture can materially lift conversion and ROI to frame expectations. [Ylopo+1](https://www.ylopo.com/blog/real-estate-lead-conversion?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
2. **5-minute SLA switch-on**
    
    Add auto-reply + triage for new inquiries (site + PPC) to guarantee first touch <5 minutes. Measure reply-time delta and booked calls. [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
3. **Micro-list “move-ready” audience**
    
    Build a 20-contact seed ([Apify](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1cxVVlORjc4eUVTclNBQjlnNFR2dm5kdVNYQXxBQ3Jtc0ttTW5VV1AwTzlBTXc3ai1nX0NfOGVLM0lQZ2dydDhkazN6Z1E5ZG1BZWgtMW9Hbm93WU55RWE5SElWaFdxMUxwaFBYalN0b1NRem9VbXpqN3VoZVNIU0xHV1poeHZ1NGdlWmpSd2o2M1Eta0xiS2ZESQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apify.com%2F%3Ffpr%3Dx1woar&v=Uj01kpjzF-0) + your query set) and send 10 hyper-relevant touches; track reply rate and meetings set. (Use your JSON actor configs as provided.)
    

The reality is: **It’s possible for you too.** These examples are typically behind thousands of dollars worth of paywalls and complex jargon, but that doesn’t have to be the case.

**Turn 25 “dead” leads into 2-3 real conversations this week** by flipping on a 5-minute reply rule and a two-step revive sequence.

No intense learning curve.

Plug and play.

**Why is this different?**

A crew of AI agents work together, and it’s possible to engineer this with almost every AI agent tool on the market.

Bring your own CRM, regardless of technical complexity, this is possible wherever there is artificial intelligence in production.

Support Tier 1 implements a **Ledger**, which is another word for the ROI Tracker or Run Log.

Everything gets tracked, nothing falls through the cracks.

### Common Q’s

- **“We’ve tried AI. It was robotic.”**
    
    *Totally. That’s why we run a tiny sample with human approval, ensuring that [recursive self improvement](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/recursive-self-improvement) has room to work. If it doesn’t book real conversations from 25–50 leads, you don’t scale it.*
    
- **“I don’t want my brand to sound weird.”**
    
    *You approve the first message. We lock your tone, then the system sticks to it.*
    
- **“Will this mess up my CRM?”**
    
    *No rip-and-replace. We plug into what you already have and write clean notes + tasks you can turn off anytime.*
    

## Property Management Lead Farm

### Convert inquiries to **booked tours** with 24/7 answers, hands-off pre-qualification, and scheduling.

1. **Always-on leasing FAQ + tour booking**
    
    Turn on AI leasing assistant for one community; compare lead-to-show week over week.
    
2. **After-hours capture pilot**
    
    Route off-hours leads to AI, daytime to humans, then compare conversion.
    
3. **Specials response test**
    
    A/B your “move-in special” message in first reply and watch lead-to-application lift.
    

The reality is: **It’s possible for you too.** These examples are typically behind [thousands of dollars](https://www.eliseai.com/customer-stories) worth of paywalls and [complex jargon](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/11/3097558/36405/en/AppFolio-Unveils-AI-Agents-to-Transform-Performance-in-Real-Estate.html), but that doesn’t have to be the case.

### Common Q’s

- **“Our staff already answers fast.”**
    
    *Awesome—AI just covers nights/weekends and the moments your team is busy. You’ll still see a jump in booked tours because nobody waits more than 2 minutes.*
    
- **“We can’t risk fair-housing issues.”**
    
    *Agreed. We lock approved language, avoid protected-class references, and route anything sensitive to a human. You approve the first templates.*
    
- **“We don’t want to change systems.”**
    
    *You don’t. We sit beside your PMS/CRM and pass clean notes, tasks, and calendar events right where your team already works.*
