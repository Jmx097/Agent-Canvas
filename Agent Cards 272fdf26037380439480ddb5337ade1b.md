# Agent Cards

Category: Asset Labs

## What they are & how to use them

**TL;DR:** Agent Cards are the one-page spec for each *digital worker* in your stack. They tell you **when to use it, what it needs, how it behaves, what it must never do,** and **how you prove it works** (HIL gates, budgets, run-logs, ROI). Think of them as “role sheets” for governed AI workers.

These are provided in your paths and don’t require much of you other than copy pasting them into your workbench. 80% of the thinking is done for you.

## Where Agent Cards fit (at a glance)

- **SOPs:** your *company standard* (the “official way we do X”).
- **Run Cards:** your *step-by-step play* (how to execute today).
- **Agent Cards (this page):** your *digital worker profile* (mission, tools, guardrails, approvals, proof).

Use them together: **SOP ⇒ Agent Card ⇒ Run Card.** SOP sets the policy, Agent Card defines the worker, Run Card is the daily checklist.

## What’s inside every Agent Card (the anatomy)

1. **Agent ID & Mission (1 sentence)** — What outcome this worker owns.
2. **When to Use / Not to Use** — Clear triggers and exclusions.
3. **Inputs & Context Pack** — Required fields, files, and links the agent will read.
4. **Tools & Access** — Connected apps, scopes, rate limits; link to **Access & Policy Matrix**.
5. **System Prompt Summary** — 5–10 bullets of rules (tone, steps, formatting).
6. **Capabilities & Boundaries** — What it *can* do; **Never-Do list** it must avoid.
7. **HIL (Human-in-the-Loop) Gates** — Approval points, thresholds, and approver.
8. **Budgets & Limits** — Max runs/day, tokens/run, timeouts, spend caps.
9. **Fallbacks & Edge Cases** — What to do on 429s, CAPTCHAs, empty states, auth fails.
10. **Run-Log Fields** — `run_id, path, step, status, tokens, cost, ms, approver`.
11. **KPIs & Success Criteria** — Hours saved, error rate, replies, bookings, revenue.
12. **Red-Team & A/B Plan** — 5 adversarial tests + how you’ll compare vs deterministic.
13. **SLA & Ownership** — On-call window, MTTR target, owner name.
14. **Version & Proof** — v#, date, Loom link, “last 10 runs” screenshot, ROI delta.

## How you’ll use Agent Cards in the program

1. **Duplicate** the Agent Card templates in your Path Pack.
2. **Wire Access** (tools, scopes) and set **HIL = ON** + budgets.
3. **Run 5 test items** (happy path + edge cases) and **log results**.
4. **Post proof** (Loom + run-log rows + KPI delta) to clear the gate.
5. **Version bump** when prompts, tools, or guardrails change.

**Gate to clear:** HIL=ON; budgets set; 10/10 runs logged; red-team table posted; KPI defined.

## Common Agent Cards you’ll see in Path Packs

- **Lead Gen:** List-Builder, First-Touch Drafter, Booking Assistant.
- **Reactivation:** Revival Sequencer, Objection Mapper, Fast-Close Offer Assistant.
- **Proposal Acceleration:** 1-Pager Drafter, Follow-Up Cadence, CRM Updater.
- **Ops Efficiency:** Inbox Triage, Data Entry Twin, Report Summarizer, Browser Worker.

Each Path ships with 2–4 pre-filled Agent Cards so you can go live fast.

## QA & Safety spine (works on any stack)

**Preflight → Orchestrate (n8n) → HIL → Deterministic fallback → Observability → Budget guards.**

Link your **Access & Policy Matrix**, **Run-Log**, **Red-Team Table**, and **ROI Tracker** right in the card.
