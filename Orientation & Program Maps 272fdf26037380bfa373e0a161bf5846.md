**Real Estate Lead Gen w/ Fellou** (cards 0–12)

**Property Services — Reactivation w/ Fellou** (cards 13–25)

**Construction — Proposal Fast Lane Roadmap w/ Fellou** (cards 26–38)

**Legal — Brighten Blind Spots Roadmap w/ Fellou** (cards 39–51)

These are non-exhaustive examples, they are each producing numerous AI digital workers with clients today. Each path demonstrates a different strength of agentic browsing and are shown through industry example. However, the crossover of lead gen with any service at a fraction of the market cost is novel and competitive.

Below is high-level on how we’re tackling it. These are arranged to be done back to back over the course of 4 months, but you can see real revenue from implementing any of them regardless of order given it fits your profile.
